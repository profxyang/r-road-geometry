# 'r-road-geometry' Project

## Introduction
The r-road-geometry project is an open-source project to extract 3D geometry of roads and identify homogeneous alignment segments.
* horizontal curves
* horizontal tangents
* vertical curves
* vertical tangents
* combinations (i.e., horizontal curve on a vertical tangent)

## Input and Output
The 2D road geometry can be supplied by the user in shapefile or, more flexibly, extracted from public data sources such as OpenStreetMap.
